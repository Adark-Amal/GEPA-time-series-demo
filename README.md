# Export and Import Price Prediction
The goal of this demo is to help companies that deal in the importation and exportation of goods and services to be able to forecast export revenue and also forecast amount spent on importation. It will also help organizations determine trends and seasonalities in their daily transactions.

This is achieved by building a model to perform the forecasting and also perform time series analysis of the organizations time series data. This app allows users to be able to train, predict and visualize the performance of the model.
